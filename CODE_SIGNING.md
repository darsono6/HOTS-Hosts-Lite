# Code Signing Policy

[← Back to README](README.md)

## Current status

HOTS Hosts Lite is currently distributed as an open-source project, but the Windows release installer is **not currently signed with a trusted commercial code-signing certificate**.

The project has not yet applied to the SignPath Foundation program or any other trusted open-source code-signing program.

The project may apply in the future as its community adoption and external visibility grow.

## Release artifact

The primary Windows release artifact is:

- `HOTS_Hosts_Lite_setup.exe`

Release artifacts are published through the project's GitHub Releases page:

https://github.com/darsono6/HOTS-Hosts-Lite/releases

## Build process

Release builds are produced through GitHub Actions.

The intended build pipeline:

1. builds the application from the public repository source;
2. compiles/packages the Python application for Windows;
3. creates the Windows installer with Inno Setup;
4. publishes the release artifact through GitHub Releases.

The project does not intentionally use locally built binaries as official release artifacts.

## Source transparency

The source code used to build HOTS Hosts Lite is publicly available in this repository.

Users who do not want to run an unsigned pre-built executable can inspect the source and build the application themselves.

## Why Windows may show a SmartScreen warning

Because the current release does not have a trusted commercial code-signing certificate and the project has limited download reputation, Windows SmartScreen may display a warning such as:

> Windows protected your PC

This warning should not be treated as proof that a file is safe or unsafe.

Users should obtain release binaries only from the official GitHub Releases page and should verify the release version before running them.

## Future signing

If HOTS Hosts Lite is accepted into a trusted open-source code-signing program or obtains another trusted signing certificate, this document will be updated with:

- the signing provider;
- the certificate identity;
- the official signing workflow;
- verification instructions;
- the date from which signed releases apply.

Until then, release binaries should be considered **unsigned**.
